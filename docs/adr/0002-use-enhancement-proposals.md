# ADR-0002: Use Enhancement Proposals for Significant Changes

## Context

As the CAPT project grows, we need a standardized way to propose and document significant changes. While we have been using ADRs for recording decisions, we need a more comprehensive format for proposing and discussing major enhancements before implementation.

## Decision

We will adopt a standardized Enhancement Proposal format (CAPTEP) for documenting significant changes to the CAPT project. The format is inspired by Kubernetes Enhancement Proposals (KEPs) but tailored to our specific needs.

The CAPTEP format includes:
- Clear metadata (number, title, status)
- Comprehensive sections (motivation, goals, implementation details)
- User stories and use cases
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies
- Upgrade and testing considerations

## Consequences

### Positive

- Better documentation of significant changes
- Structured approach to proposing enhancements
- Clear historical record of design decisions
- Improved review process for major changes

### Negative

- Additional overhead for documenting changes
- Potential for process to slow down development
- Need to maintain format consistency

### Neutral

- Need to determine what constitutes a "significant change"
- May need to evolve format over time
- Requires balancing thoroughness with practicality
