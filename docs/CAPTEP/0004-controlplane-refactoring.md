# CAPTEP-0004: CAPTControlPlane Controller Refactoring

## Summary

This proposal outlines a comprehensive refactoring of the CAPTControlPlane controller to improve code organization, maintainability, and testability.

## Motivation

The current CAPTControlPlane controller implementation has several issues:

1. All controller logic is contained in a single file, making it difficult to maintain and understand
2. Lack of clear separation of concerns
3. Inconsistent error handling patterns
4. Limited test coverage
5. Mixed responsibilities in status management

These issues make it challenging to maintain and extend the controller, and increase the risk of bugs.

## Goals

- Improve code organization through better separation of concerns
- Establish consistent patterns across the codebase
- Enhance error handling and status management
- Increase test coverage
- Make the code more maintainable and easier to understand

## Non-Goals

- Changing the core functionality of the controller
- Modifying the API structure
- Adding new features
- Changing the underlying infrastructure provider integration

## Proposal

### File Structure

Reorganize the controller code into multiple files with clear responsibilities:

```
internal/controller/controlplane/
├── controller.go        # Main controller logic
├── status.go           # Status management
├── finalizer.go        # Finalizer handling
├── workspace.go        # WorkspaceTemplate operations
├── types.go           # Common types and constants
└── tests/             # Test files
```

### Component Responsibilities

1. Main Controller (controller.go)
   - Reconciliation loop
   - Resource ownership management
   - High-level orchestration

2. Status Management (status.go)
   - Status condition updates
   - Status-related helper functions
   - Consistent status reporting

3. Finalizer Handling (finalizer.go)
   - Resource cleanup
   - Finalizer addition/removal
   - Deletion workflows

4. Workspace Operations (workspace.go)
   - WorkspaceTemplate management
   - WorkspaceTemplateApply operations
   - Workspace-related utilities

### Error Handling Improvements

1. Consistent Error Types
   - Define domain-specific error types
   - Implement error wrapping
   - Clear error context

2. Status Updates
   - Separate error handling from status updates
   - Consistent condition updates
   - Improved error reporting

### Testing Strategy

1. Unit Tests
   - Component-level testing
   - Mock dependencies
   - Edge case coverage

2. Integration Tests
   - Component interaction testing
   - End-to-end workflows
   - Failure scenarios

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: File Structure (Week 1)

1. Create new directory structure
2. Move existing code to appropriate files
3. Ensure functionality remains unchanged

### Phase 2: Refactoring (Week 2-3)

1. Implement new patterns
2. Update error handling
3. Add helper functions
4. Improve status management

### Phase 3: Testing (Week 4)

1. Add unit tests
2. Implement integration tests
3. Verify coverage
4. Fix any issues found

## Risks and Mitigation

### Risks

1. Breaking Changes
   - Risk: Refactoring could introduce bugs
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive testing and gradual rollout

2. Performance Impact
   - Risk: New patterns could affect performance
   - Mitigation: Performance testing and monitoring

3. Migration Complexity
   - Risk: Complex changes could be difficult to review
   - Mitigation: Clear documentation and phased implementation

## Alternatives Considered

1. Complete Rewrite
   - Rejected due to high risk and time investment
   - Current functionality works, just needs better organization

2. Minimal Changes
   - Rejected as it wouldn't address core issues
   - Technical debt would continue to grow

## Implementation History

- 2024-XX-XX: Initial proposal
- (Future dates to be added as implementation progresses)
